Pixel Shift

A lightweight Python utility to quickly bulk-copy or bulk-move images from one directory to another. Perfect for cleaning up folders or aggregating assets for projects. This is my first python script. It can copy or move thousands of images from source to destination quickly.


Features
* Smart Detection: Automatically filters for `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.ico`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`, `.tif`, and `.webp`.
* Two Modes: Copy: Duplicate images to a new folder (safe).
*  Move: Transfer images to a new folder (cleans up the source).
* Validation: Validates source and destination paths before running to prevent errors.
* No Dependencies: Uses only standard Python libraries (`os` and `shutil`).
